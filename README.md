## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+** (LTS version recommended)
- **Git** for version control
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions
- **Gradle** (system install, optional) — only for `examples/Calculator_Application`

### Quick Setup
1. **Install Java 17+:**
   - Download from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)
   - Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
   - Verify: `java -version` and `javac -version`

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Davin-X/java-development.git
   cd java-development
   ```

3. **Choose your learning path:**
   - **Beginners**: Start with `0_Getting_Started/`
   - **Intermediates**: Jump to `1_Beginner/` for foundation
   - **Advanced**: Explore `3_Advanced/` for senior topics

### Recommended IDE Setup
- **VS Code**: Install "Extension Pack for Java" and "Gradle for Java"
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Community Edition is free and recommended
- **Eclipse**: Install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
